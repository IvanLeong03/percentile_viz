I am interested in comparing performances of players. Although there are many existing tools for this purpose, such as datamb.football's convenient radar chart tool, I made this to train my coding and web scraping skills.

I may make further changes in the future, such as allowing more than two players, generating a score based on weighted metrics for each player, etc.

However, I have been using this tool much less since datamb.football was released, as it feels more convenient. That tool is amazing and anyone should check it out.
